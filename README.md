# STARK_ML
The library contains some of the most common Machine Learning
algorithms implemented from scratch with examples of their use.

The library was created for educational purposes.
It is designed to partially mimic the functionality of the scikit-learn
ML library and uses some of its function names and parameter names.

The complete documentation can be found at https://starkml.webflow.io/
